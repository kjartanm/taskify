# Taskify Project - Critical Risks

## 1. Child Privacy and Data Protection Compliance Risk

**Risk**: The app targets children aged 10-15, making it subject to strict privacy regulations like COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), GDPR Article 8, and other international child protection laws.

**Impact**: Non-compliance could result in significant fines, legal action, and project shutdown.

**Considerations**: Need parental consent mechanisms, data minimization, secure data handling, and age verification systems.

## 2. Complex User Role Management and Security Risk

**Risk**: The dual-user system (parents and children) with different permission levels creates complex authentication and authorization challenges.

**Impact**: Security vulnerabilities could expose children's data or allow unauthorized access to accounts.

**Considerations**: Robust parent-child account linking, secure session management, and proper access controls between different user types.

## 3. Market Saturation and Competition Risk

**Risk**: The task management market is highly competitive with established players like Trello, Todoist, and specialized kid-focused apps.

**Impact**: Difficulty gaining market traction, user acquisition challenges, and potential inability to achieve sustainable user base.

**Considerations**: Need clear differentiation strategy and validation of actual demand from target demographic.

## 4. Feature Complexity vs. Usability Risk

**Risk**: The pitch includes many sophisticated features (gamification, badges, points system, notifications, multiple views) that could overwhelm the target age group.

**Impact**: Poor user experience leading to low adoption and retention rates among children.

**Considerations**: Balancing feature richness with age-appropriate simplicity and conducting extensive user testing with actual children.

## 5. Parental Engagement and Adoption Risk

**Risk**: The app's success depends heavily on parents actively creating accounts, managing children's access, and participating in the reward system.

**Impact**: Low parental engagement could result in abandoned accounts and poor user retention.

**Considerations**: Parents may not have time or interest in managing another digital tool, and the value proposition for parents needs to be compelling beyond just organizing their children's tasks.
